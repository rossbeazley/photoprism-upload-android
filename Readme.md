This will watch the camera folder and use webdav to upload images

VERY NEXT: change Sync Queue to have entries expire after time not right away, will need dates

Sort of a task list:

✓ - done
✇ - doing
❌ - dropped
😎 - re-work

audit logs: 
 rework audit logs so they are "proper", maybe a json object?
 add an audit log screen with actual list
 add a way to clear logs

photo upload screen - stub:
 add list of synced photos, path and status
 render text list of synced photos
 add thumbnail of photo to list

upload task:
✓ actually upload something using work manager
 include progress notification
✓ add to failed queue

failed uploads:
 rework sync list add filter so just failed items
 add re-sync button

later:
 show current workmanager items if possible
 restart background service





System Collaborators:

File watcher service: ✓
 collaborates with upload service
 filewatcher adapter plugs into this 
 

Foreground service:
 just shows a low priority service
 could "house" the file watcher, but no need

Upload service:
 takes a file path
 collaborates with sync queue
 collaborates with work manager to run work in background
 uses webdav in some way

Sync queue: ✓
 has a View
 can retry an item - removes from queue as its not failed
 can enqueue a failed item
 needs persistence

Audit Logs:
 has a view
 can add an entry
 can get all the entries
 needs persistence




Next up:
✓ - rework callback for work manager to promote to explicit public primary port
✓ - write adapter for file watcher service
✓ - write status event observable flow
✓ - write adapter to persist sync queue
✓ - implement work manager integration
✓ - implement AuditRepo adapter for now
✓ - complete rest of audit logs
✓ - wire everything together
✓ - implement keep alive task
 - do upload service integration tests against test service (needs deploying)
 - audit log screen
 - real audit log service, sharedprefs at first, maybe with json then sqlite or summit

 - WORK OUT WHATS LEFT, DRAW A DIAGRAM

 - "share" photo to sync
 - notice what the last file was and discover newer photos, maybe when we detect a new photo or on button press
 - render the sync queue
 - retry a failed download
 - jetpack compose
 - configuration screen, server url, creds, retry count, backoff time, directory to watch
